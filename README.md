# About ft_printf

The aim of this project is to reimplement the printf() function.  

# Implementation  

Here is the flags that are implemented:  

• %c Prints a single character.  
• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).  
• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.  
• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.  
• %i Prints an integer in base 10.  
• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.  
• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.  
• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.  
• %% Prints a percent sign.  

And for the bonus:  

• # Adds the 0x prefix for hexadecimal.  
•   Adds a space in front of positive numbers.  
• + Prints the sign of the number.
